Jason Momoa (Aquaman) will star in the ""Helldivers"" movie adaptation from ""Fast & Furious 6"" director Justin Lin.

Helldivers 2, which launched in 2024, sold more than 12 million copies across PS5 and PC in its first four months, and now the Arrowhead Game Studios project will get the Uncharted treatment with a live action movie.

The story riffs on classic tropes from Starship Troopers, a satire of military fascism through a sci-fi lens, where jingoistic soldiers fight to save Super Earth from various alien threats.

It's unclear what precise events the movie will follow or what role Momoa plays within them, but as a lead he'll likely be in the middle of the action.

With the success of HBO's ""The Last of Us"" and the ""Uncharted"" movie, which Deadline reports earned $407 million globally, it's no surprise Sony is banking on more of its big video game franchises for blockbuster success.

"A shutdown of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that took effect early Saturday impacts the agency responsible for screening passengers and bags at airports across the country. Travelers with airline reservations may be nervously recalling a 43-day government shutdown that led to historic flight cancellations and long delays last year.

Transportation Security Administration officers are expected to work without pay while lawmakers remain without an agreement on DHS' annual funding. TSA officers also worked through the record shutdown that ended Nov. 12, but aviation experts say this one may play out differently.

Trade groups for the U.S. travel industry and major airlines nonetheless warned that the longer DHS appropriations are lapsed, the longer security lines at the nation's commercial airports could get.

Here's what to know about the latest shutdown and how to plan ahead.

What's different about this shutdown?

Funding for Homeland Security expired at midnight. But the rest of the federal government is funded through Sept. 30. That means air traffic controllers employed by the Federal Aviation Administration will receive paychecks as usual, reducing the risk of widespread flight cancellations.

According to the department's contingency plan, about 95% of TSA workers are deemed essential personnel and required to keep working. Democrats in the House and Senate say DHS won't get funded until new restrictions are placed on federal immigration operations.

During past shutdowns, disruptions to air travel tended to build over time, not overnight. About a month into last year's shutdown, for example, TSA temporarily closed two checkpoints at Philadelphia International Airport. That same day, the government took the extraordinary step of ordering all commercial airlines to reduce their domestic flight schedules.

John Clark, arriving at Detroit Metropolitan Airport from a business trip in Mississippi, said he was impacted by that earlier shutdown and is worried.

""You might not be able to get home if you're already out, or it might delay if you worked all week and you're trying to get home,"" said Clark, who frequently travels for his job balancing machines. ""It's really bad.""

John Rose, chief risk officer for global travel management company Altour, said strains could surface at airports more quickly this time because the TSA workforce also will be remembering the last shutdown.

""It's still fresh in their minds and potentially their pocketbooks,"" Rose said.

What is the impact on travelers?

It's hard to predict whether, when or where security screening snags might pop up. Even a handful of unscheduled TSA absences could quickly lead to longer wait times at smaller airports, for example, if there's just a single security checkpoint.

That's why travelers should plan to arrive early and allow extra time to get through security.

""I tell people to do this even in good times,"" Rose said.

Experts say flight delays also are a possibility even though air traffic controllers are not affected by the DHS shutdown.

Airlines might decide to delay departures in some cases to wait for passengers to clear screening, said Rich Davis, senior security adviser at risk mitigation company International SOS. Shortages of TSA officers also could slow the screening of checked luggage behind the scenes.

Burnest R. Green, who flew to Detroit from Phoenix for his sister's 70th birthday, says he wants the shutdown ended before he flies back in over a week's time.

""I just hope that things start to get better before they get any worse,"" he said.

What travelers can do to prepare

Most airports display security line wait times on their websites, but don't wait until the day of a flight to check them, Rose advised.

""You may look online and it says two-and-a-half hours,"" he said. ""Now it's two-and-a-half hours before your flight and you haven't left for the airport yet.""

Passengers should also pay close attention while packing since prohibited items are likely to prolong the screening process. For carry-on bags, avoid bringing full-size shampoo or other liquids, large gels or aerosols and items like pocketknives in carry-on bags.

TSA has a full list on its website of what is and isn't allowed in carry-on and checked luggage.

At the airport, Rose said, remember to ""practice patience and empathy.""

""Not only are they not getting paid,"" he said of TSA agents, ""they're probably working with reduced staff and dealing with angry travelers.""

Will the shutdown drag on?

The White House has been negotiating with Democratic lawmakers, but the two sides failed to reach a deal by the end of the week before senators and members of Congress were set to leave Washington for a 10-day break.

Lawmakers in both chambers were on notice, however, to return if a deal to end the shutdown is struck.

Democrats have said they won't help approve more DHS funding until new restrictions are placed on federal immigration operations after the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti and Renee Good in Minneapolis last month.

In a joint statement, U.S. Travel, Airlines for America and the American Hotel & Lodging Association warned that the shutdown threatens to disrupt air travel as the busy spring break travel season approaches.

""Travelers and the U.S. economy cannot afford to have essential TSA personnel working without pay, which increases the risk of unscheduled absences and call outs, and ultimately can lead to higher wait times and missed or delayed flights,"" the statement said.

"MUNICH (AP) — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio offered a reassuring message to America's allies on Saturday, striking a less aggressive but still firm tone about the administration's intent to reshape the trans-Atlantic alliance and push its priorities after more than a year of President Donald Trump's often-hostile rhetoric toward traditional allies.

Reminding his audience at the annual Munich Security Conference about America's centuries-long roots in Europe, Rubio said the United States would remain forever tied to the continent even as it pushes for changes in the relationship and the institutions that have been the bulwark of the post-World War II world order.

READ MORE: Germany's Merz calls on U.S. and Europe to 'repair and revive trans-Atlantic trust together'

Rubio addressed the conference a year after Vice President JD Vance stunned the same audience with a harsh critique of European values. A series of Trump administration statements and moves targeting allies followed, including Trump's short-lived threat last month to impose new tariffs on several European countries in a bid to secure U.S. control of Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark.

On Friday, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz had opened this year's gathering by calling for the U.S. and Europe to ""repair and revive trans-Atlantic trust together,"" saying that even the U.S. isn't powerful enough to go it alone in an world whose old order no longer exists. But he and other European officials made clear that they will stand by their values, including their approach to free speech, climate change and free trade.

'A child of Europe'

While offering a calmer and more reassuring tone, Rubio made clear that the Trump administration is sticking to its guns on policy. He denounced ""a climate cult"" and ""an unprecedented wave of mass migration that threatens the cohesion of our societies.""

Rubio argued that the ""euphoria"" of the Western victory in the Cold War led to a ""dangerous delusion that we had entered 'the end of history,' that every nation would now be a liberal democracy, that the ties formed by trade and by commerce alone would now replace nationhood ... and that we would now live in a world without borders where everyone became a citizen of the world.""

""We made these mistakes together and now together we owe it to our people to face those facts and to move forward to rebuild,"" Rubio said.

""This is why we Americans may sometimes come off as a little direct and urgent in our counsel,"" he said. ""This is why President Trump demands seriousness and reciprocity from our friends here in Europe.""

Rubio said that an end of the trans-Atlantic era ""is neither our goal nor our wish,"" adding that ""our home may be in the Western hemisphere, but we will always be a child of Europe.""

He acknowledged that ""we have bled and died side-by-side on battlefields from Kapyong to Kandahar,"" a contrast with disparaging remarks by Trump about NATO allies' troops in Afghanistan that drew an outcry. ""And I'm here today to make it clear that America is charting the path for a new century of prosperity. and that once again, we want to do it together with you, our cherished allies and our oldest friends.""

U.S. officials accompanying Rubio said his message was much the same as Vance's last year but was intended to have a softer landing on the audience, which they acknowledged had recoiled at much of Trump's rhetoric over the past year.

Europeans reassured but not complacent

The president of the European Union's executive commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said Rubio's speech was ""very reassuring"" but noted that ""in the administration, some have a harsher tone on these topics.""

In her speech to the conference, she stressed that ""Europe must become more independent,"" including on defense. She insisted on Europe's ""digital sovereignty"" — its approach to hate speech on social media.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that ""we shouldn't get in the warm bath of complacency. He said the U.K. must reforge closer ties with Europe to help the continent ""stand on our own two feet"" in its own defense, and said there needs to be investment that ""moves us from overdependence to interdependence.""

Hanno Pevkur, the defense minister of EU and NATO member Estonia, said it was ""quite a bold statement to say that America is 'a child of Europe'.""

""It was a good speech, needed here today, but that doesn't mean that we can rest on pillows now,"" he told The Associated Press. ""So still a lot of work has to be done.""

Rubio didn't mention Greenland. After last month's escalation over Trump's designs on the Arctic island, the U.S., Denmark and Greenland started technical talks on an Arctic security deal.

The secretary of state met briefly in Munich on Friday with the Danish and Greenlandic leaders, a meeting Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen described as constructive.

But Frederiksen suggested Saturday that, although the dispute has cooled, she remains wary. Asked whether the crisis has passed, she replied: ""No, unfortunately not. I think the desire from the U.S. president is exactly the same. He is very serious about this theme.""

Asked whether she can put a price on Greenland, she said ""of course not,"" adding that ""we have to respect sovereign states ... and we have to respect people's right for self-determination. And the Greenlandic people have been very clear, they don't want to become Americans.""

"GENEVA (AP) — Iran and the United States will hold a second round of talks over Tehran's nuclear program next week, the Swiss Foreign Ministry said Saturday.

Oman, which welcomed the first round of indirect talks on Feb. 6, will host the talks in Geneva, the Swiss ministry said, without specifying which days.

After the first discussions, U.S. President Donald Trump warned Tehran that failure to reach an agreement with his administration would be ""very traumatic.""

Similar talks last year broke down in June as Israel launched what became a 12-day war on Iran that included the U.S. bombing Iranian nuclear sites.

Trump has repeatedly threatened to use force to compel Iran to agree to constrain its nuclear program. Iran has said it would respond with an attack of its own. Trump also has threatened Iran over its deadly crackdown on recent nationwide protests there.

Gulf Arab nations have warned any attack could spiral into another regional conflict.

Trump said Friday the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world's largest aircraft carrier, was being sent from the Caribbean to the Mideast to join other military assets the U.S. has built up in the region. He also said a change in power in Iran ""would be the best thing that could happen.""

The indirect talks on Feb. 6 were between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff. The top military commander in the Middle East was also present for the first time.

The Trump administration has maintained that Iran can have no uranium enrichment under any deal. Tehran says it won't agree to that.

Iran has insisted its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. However, its officials increasingly threaten to pursue a nuclear weapon. Before the June war, Iran had been enriching uranium up to 60% purity, a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels.

Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has said his nation is ""ready for any kind of verification."" However, the United Nations' nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, has been unable for months to inspect and verify Iran's nuclear stockpile.

Trump has suggested in recent weeks that his top priority is for Iran to scale back its nuclear program. Iran has said it wants talks to focus solely on the nuclear program.

But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who met with Trump in Washington this week, has pressed for any deal to include steps to neutralize Iran's ballistic missile program and end its funding for proxy groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah.",politics

As artificial intelligence tools become more commonplace, many game studios have been testing them to speed up production. Games like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and Arc Raiders shipped with AI assets, but Grand Theft Auto 6 won't follow in their footsteps.

Ahead of Rockstar parent company Take-Two's Q3 financial results, CEO Strauss Zelnick told GamesIndustry.biz that ""generative AI has zero part in what Rockstar Games is building"" for GTA 6.

This follows a previous comment to CNBC, where Zelnick said, ""there is no creativity that can exist by definition in any AI model, because it is data-driven.""

Zelnick says Rockstar's games are ""handcrafted"" and that's what makes them special.

""They're built from the ground up, building by building, street by street, neighborhood by neighborhood,"" Zelnick said. ""They're not procedurally generated, they shouldn't be. That's what makes great entertainment.""

While these comments might suggest the CEO is against the technology, he admits Take-Two has ""hundreds of pilots and implementations"" across the company to drive cost and time efficiencies. It just doesn't look like it will be a part of the creative process any time soon.

These comments come after the release of Google's Project Genie, which claims to create ""playable worlds"" at the touch of a button. However, the examples we've seen so far are at the very least heavily inspired by other works. They can also only run for 60 seconds because of the sheer compute cost.

Despite that, many game companies saw their stock prices crash, including Take-Two, with Google's announcement.",sports
